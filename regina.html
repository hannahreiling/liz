							<ul>
								<li>One of my favorite memories with you is the ENTIRE Duke trip - drinking airport mimosas, going to Shooter's, and functioning on minimal sleep!</li>
								<li>I will never forget how we drunkenly took over the stage at the 2019 Baltimore CASE Dance party...you're definitely one of my favorite dance partners!!</li>
								<li>Spending some quality time in the O (...and getting kicked out of Hem's, and meeting our policeman friend at SkyVue...) on your 21st birtday was a sign of all the fun to come during senior year!</li>
								<li>Our roommate shenanigans always give me something to look forward to when I get home, from hosting BG dinner parties to tracking the 2020 election to our heart-to-heart chats!</li>
								<li>Most of all, getting to call you my friend is something I'm so grateful for. From our nights out on the town to our seemingly endless days spent studying in the BG room, I am so blessed to have you in my life. Love you!!</li>
